**Updated Readme coming soon**


##Currently Working On
- Custom fields in editor for Peer Reviews

##Todo List
- PMID hyperlink after Bibliography
- Hand-typed reference fields
- jQueryUI peer review beautification
    + **Bug:** Upload photo script for third reviewer set works intermittantly.
- Integrate CrossRef / CSL Citations API
    + **Note:** It appears that in order to do this, I'd have to include a huge javascript library in the build (citeproc.js)
